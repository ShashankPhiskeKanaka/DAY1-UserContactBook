Day 1 : Routing, Controllers, Validations, Config Management
 
Topics to learn:
Routing
Layered architecture (Controller -> Service -> Repo)
Validation (manual + library like Zod/Joi)
Serialization/Deserialization
ENV-based config setup
Request lifecycle
Practical tips:
Use concepts you learned in previous training
Create clean folder structure 
Add custom validation layer  
Add global config loader with environment switching
Assignment:

Build a mini User Contact Book API
Must include:

1. CRUD for contacts (name, email, phone, address)
2. Strict validation using Zod/Joi
3. Custom JSON serializer (remove internal fields before returning)
4. ENV-based config (dev, stage, prod)
5. Middleware for logging request + execution time
6. Error classes + unified response format
7. Controller -> service -> repo architecture (mandatory)
